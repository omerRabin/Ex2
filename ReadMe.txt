In this project we improved the previous tasks so that the algrorithm can be used on directed graphs.
The nodes numbered by uniques keys. Each edge in the graph has a weight. Each edge connects 2 vertices in a way that can be moved on the edge.
we created the graph using hash map because its very efficient in terms of runtimes and very suitable for the structure of a graph.
We can get a node in the graph, check if edge exists, get a specific edge, add node to the graph, connect between two nodes-make an edge,
 retrieval of the whole graph, retrieval neighbor group of specific node(all nodes that have a common edge with this node), remove node, remove edge
init the graph, copy the graph, check if the graph is connected(what means that there is a path from each node in the graph to each node in the graph),
 compute the shortest path in the graph between two given node and return the path's length, and option to save and load a specific graph to json file.
